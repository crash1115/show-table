# show-table
A Foundry VTT module that adds a "Show Players" option to the header buttons for Rollable Tables. It shows to all players. Players who don't have sufficient permissions to view the table will see a yellow warning message at the top of their screen.

# Support and Help
If you install this module, you do so at your own risk. I made this module for a game I'm in, and I have no desire to support it for the greater Foundry community. Unless you're my DM, I won't be taking feature requests or responding to bugs or other issues. (If you are my DM, it'll cost you; I'll take a pet cat made of moss, a pair of flame tongue greatswords without the Heavy property, or some +10 plate.)

If you want this to be supported more than I'm willing to, feel free to fork this repo and do it yourself. See the license file for all the boring stuff you need to know about that.
